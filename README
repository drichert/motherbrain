Format strings:
  - bytes represented in hex except for placeholders
  - placeholders consist of a number, optionally followed by
    an "m" or "l" (case insensitive) indicator, enclosed in square brackets
    - the number is the number of bits for the value
    - trailing "m" or "l" indicates most signifant bit or least significant bit
        - left-padded with 0s if "l"/"L"
        - right-padded with 0s if "m"/"M"
        - if "m" or "l" indicator is not present, do not pad


[4m] - 4 bit number (most significant)
[8M] - 8 bit number (most significant)
[7l] - 7 bit number (least significant) -- (pad beginning w/ 0)
[8L] - 8 bit number (least significant)
